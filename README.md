# MenuMind - AI-Powered Restaurant Experience

**MenuMind** is a modern digital menu and restaurant management platform designed to replace traditional paper menus with QR-based, AI-powered experiences.  
It enables restaurants to manage menus, categories, and items in real time, while allowing guests to interact with an intelligent chatbot that understands the restaurant’s actual menu data.

## Overview

MenuMind solves three core problems in modern restaurants:

1. **Static menus** - paper menus are expensive to update and error-prone
2. **Poor customer experience** - guests often have questions about ingredients, allergies, or recommendations
3. **Disconnected systems** - menus, QR codes, and customer interaction tools rarely work together

MenuMind combines **QR codes**, **real-time menu management**, and an **AI chatbot** connected directly to the restaurant’s database.
